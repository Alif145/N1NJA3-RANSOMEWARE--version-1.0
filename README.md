Android ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to encrypt or lock a user's data on an Android device, demanding a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key or unlocking mechanism. Here are some key features and characteristics of Android ransomware:

Encryption: Some advanced Android ransomware encrypts the user's files, making them inaccessible without the decryption key. This is similar to how ransomware operates on other platforms.

Locking the Device: Many Android ransomware variants lock the device's screen, preventing the user from accessing any apps or data. This is often accompanied by a ransom note demanding payment to unlock the device.

Social Engineering: Ransomware often uses social engineering tactics to trick users into installing the malware. This can include phishing emails, malicious links, or fake apps that mimic legitimate software.

Exploitation of Vulnerabilities: Some ransomware exploits vulnerabilities in the Android operating system or third-party apps to gain unauthorized access and execute malicious code.

Data Exfiltration: In addition to encrypting or locking data, some ransomware may also exfiltrate sensitive information from the device, such as personal photos, documents, or login credentials.

Persistence: Ransomware often includes mechanisms to ensure it persists on the device, even after a reboot. This can involve modifying system settings, disabling security features, or using root exploits.
